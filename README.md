Performance testing of REST API using Apache JMeter

Currency Converter API is a REST API which gives the current rate of around 77 currencies.

This API is freely available on https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/currency-converter5.

Using JMeter I have created a performance test plan to test the performance of the API as per the mentioned benchmark.

## Prerequisites

1.Java 1.8 or higher

2.Apache JMeter tool

Step 2 : Open the .jmx  file in JMeter.

Step 3 :In JMeter go to HTTP Header Manager and enter your API KEY in X-RapidAPI-Key header.

Step 5 :Edit the number of threads/virtual users that will be executing the request.

## Built With
